# My Work
Below is a portfolio of the major papers and presentations I've done in my time in college, related to my majors of Biology and Mathematics w/ Statistics concentration. The projects themselves are from a variety of classes, some of which I've described below.

### Biology
* Modeling the Systems of Life: In this class, I was introduced to biological research methods and the model organism Cordylophora caspia, an invasive, colonial hydroid found in the class Hydrozoa. I conducted PCR and Gel Electrophoresis on hydranth (feeding polyp) DNA, wrote a [literature review](biol252_literature_review.pdf), and conducted a half-semester long research project on the effects of eutrophication of C. caspia growth and wrote the [research report](biol252_research_paper.pdf).
* Invertebrate Zoology: In this class, I was introduced to dozens of invertebrate phyla and saw example organisms from almost all of them in a laboratory setting. I conducted vivisections on whole shellfish, wrote and presented a [literature review](biol335_review_paper.docx) on the invasive tunicate Ciona intestinalis, and participated in a field study where I, along with the rest of the class, collected and identified dozens of invertebrates from a local pond. I invite you to read my [research report](biol335_review_paper.pdf) and [my presentation](biol_335_topic_presentation.pdf).
* Genetics: In this class, I learned about DNA, its structure, and its roles in cell processes such as mitosis and mRNA transcription. I, along with two lab partners, conducted a controlled cross to examine the inheritance of mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila and exposited journal articles to the class.

### Mathematics
* Introduction to Upper-Level Math: This class taught the history and philosophy of math as well as the process by which mathematical research is done in the 21st century. I learned and extensively practiced mathematical writing with LaTeX and exposited a journal article in applied mathematics to the class with one partner.
* Probability Theory: This course explained the mathematical basis behind probabilities, including combinatorics, various distributions, and the central limit theorem. 
* Mathematical Statistics: This course took the principles of Probability Theory and applied them to modern data analysis with concepts such as estimators, hypothesis testing, regression, and ANOVA. This course also taught these concepts in relation to R.
* Mathematical Modeling: In this class, I learned about the process of making mathematical models to describe real-world phenomena. The class taught concepts such as linear regression, interpolation, splines, and numerical solutions to differential equations. 
* Machine Learning: This course introduced basic machine learning concepts such as the k-nearest neighbors model, PCA, and penalized regression and taught them largely in relation to R.
